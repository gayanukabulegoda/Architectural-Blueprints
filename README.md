## Architectural Blueprints

This repository is a comprehensive guide for software architecture enthusiasts. It serves as a practical blueprint by offering real-world examples to help you understand and implement:

- **SOLID Principles** – Simple, practical examples that illustrate each of the five SOLID principles.
- **Design Patterns** – Hands-on demonstrations covering common design patterns:
  - **Creational Patterns** (e.g., Singleton, Factory)
  - **Structural Patterns** (e.g., Facade, Decorator)
  - **Behavioral Patterns** (e.g., Observer, Strategy)

Each topic is organized into its dedicated branch, making it easy to focus on the area you need.

## Branches and Content

- **practical/SOLID**  
  Contains clear, beginner-friendly examples that demonstrate the application of SOLID principles in software design.

- **practical/DesignPatterns**  
  Features practical examples of design patterns categorized into:
  - **Creational Patterns** (e.g., Singleton, Factory)
  - **Structural Patterns** (e.g., Facade, Decorator)
  - **Behavioral Patterns** (e.g., Observer, Strategy)

## Practical Examples

### SOLID Principles

- **Overview:**  
  Dive into practical examples that illustrate the Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion principles.
- **Accessing the Examples:**  
  Clone the SOLID branch with the following command:
  ```bash
  git clone -b practical/SOLID --single-branch https://github.com/gayanukabulegoda/Architectural-Blueprints.git
  ```

### Design Patterns

- **Overview:**  
  Explore hands-on implementations of common design patterns used in modern software development. The examples are organized into creational, structural, and behavioral categories.
- **Accessing the Examples:**  
  Clone the Design Patterns branch with the following command:
  ```bash
  git clone -b practical/DesignPatterns --single-branch https://github.com/gayanukabulegoda/Architectural-Blueprints.git
  ```
